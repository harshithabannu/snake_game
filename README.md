# Snake Game

## Overview

Welcome to the Snake Game repository! This project features a classic Snake game built using Pygame. The game challenges players to navigate a snake around the screen to eat food, grow in length, and avoid collisions with the walls or itself. The game includes a scoring system, a pause feature, and increasing difficulty based on the player's score.

## Description

In this Snake game, you control a snake that moves around a grid to eat randomly placed food items. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the game speeds up. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible by consuming as much food as you can while avoiding collisions with the screen edges or the snakeâ€™s own body. The game also features a pause function that allows players to temporarily stop the game, and a game over screen that provides an option to restart the game by pressing space.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay:** Navigate the snake to eat food and grow.
- **Score System:** Track your score as you eat food. The game speeds up as you score more points.
- **Pause Feature:** Pause the game by pressing the spacebar. Press it again to resume.
- **Game Over Screen:** Display a game over message and allow the player to restart the game by pressing space.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** The game's speed increases as the score goes up.
- **Game Reset:** Restart the game after a game over to play again.
